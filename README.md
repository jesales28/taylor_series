Name: Julia Sales
Class: Foundations of Scientific Computing for Scientists and Engineers

### description
A computer program that computes Taylor series expansions of three different functions to get more experience with Python and numpy with specific focus on a recursive implementation. Project was worked on in a team of two. I was the main driver for half of this project.
